/*
    THIS IS A REQUIRED FILE, PLEASE DO NOT DELETE IT!

    This file contains the list of custom components that will be used by your theme. If you created a custom component
    manually (without using "sfb-toolkit components-add" or "sfb-toolkit components-copy" commands) you will need
    to add the component to this file (see example below) for it to be recognized by the theme.
    i.e: export { default as yourComponentName } from 'path/to/custom/component'
